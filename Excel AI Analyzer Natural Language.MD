Create a desktop application with a light gray GUI that includes a title 'Excel AI Analyzer', a description text, two buttons - a green 'Search and Load' button and a blue 'Apply AI' button (initially disabled), a file status label, a data preview table with scrollbars showing the first 50 rows of loaded data, and a text area for displaying analysis results. The app should let users browse and load Excel or CSV files, automatically display the data in the table, enable the AI button after loading, and when clicked, perform statistical analysis, correlation detection, PCA, and K-means clustering, displaying detailed results in the text area.
